I had some issues cloning my repo after I had worked on my code. Nick Gambino helped me fix this by
1) made a new GitHub repo
2) made a temp location to clone
3) copied my written code into a new folder
4) deleted old folder that did not have the repo cloned (scary!)

Thanks to tutors Faran and Daniel for helping me connect the dots!

Some things I'm still struggling with are:
1) moving my icon image under my name
2) adding descriptive tags on my images, can see where I tried to edit Lumahai beach image under recent work
